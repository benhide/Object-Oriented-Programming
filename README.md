# Object-Oriented-Programming
An image processing console application which performs mean, median and sigma-clipped median blending techniques, for image stacking. Also features image scaling using nearest neigbour and bilinear scaling algorithms and image read writing in PPM format.

Applys the concepts of advanced software development and programming methods to computational problems and uses advanced object oriented principles and programming techniques used in software development. The console application demostrates object oriented programming principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. The application uses techniques such as objects, classes and operator overloading.
